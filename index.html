                Welcome to the game of blackjack. Blackjack is a game of choices and chance. The name of the game is to beat the dealer
                and get closest to 21 while not exceeding it, once you exceed 21 you bust and lose. The player has 3-4 choices when 
                playing the game, hit, stand, double and split. Hitting will give you another card, if you choose to stand you get no 
                further cards, if you choose double, the bet will double and you only get 1 more card. There will be instances where 
                you get two cards of equal numbers, in that case you get the option to split the cards and play 2 seperate hands.
                While the player gets to make these choices, the house dosen't. The house is forced to hit while it has a sum of less 
                than 17, and has to stand if it's 17 or above. Face cards count as a 10, aces count as 11, unless you exceed 21 then 
                they count as a 1, and the rest of the cards count as their own numerical values.
